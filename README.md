## 🎥 Project 2: Favorite Movie Organizer
### Description
A simple application designed to help users manage and keep track of their movie collection. It provides a foundational structure for storing, viewing, and organizing their favorite movie data.

### Key Features
*   **Add New Movie:**
    *   A form component allowing users to input movie details (e.g., **Title**, **Rating**, **Genre**, **Year**, and potentially a **Poster URL**).  
    *   Input validation using JavaScript to ensure required fields are filled and data types are correct.  
*   **Display Movie List:**     
    *   Movies are displayed as visually appealing **"movie cards"** or a list, created dynamically by JavaScript.    
    *   Movie data persists, ideally using the browser's **Local Storage** so the list remains saved even after the user closes and reopens the page.      
*   **Search and Filter:**  
    *   A search bar functionality to filter the displayed movies by **title** or other attributes in real-time.      
    *   Options to sort the list (e.g., by **Rating** (highest to lowest) or **Title** (alphabetically)).       
*   **Edit and Delete:** 
    *   Each movie card includes buttons or icons to **Edit** its details or **Delete** it from the list.
